I am a final year Bioinformatics master’s student at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/kuleuven/index.html) with an interest in computational and molecular biology, multi-omics data integration, and environmental sustainability. My master's thesis is centered on the characterization of microproteins in the proteome landscape.

Previously, I worked as a Bio-Lab manager in a non-profit organization called [Center for Sustainable Agriculture (CSA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_for_Sustainable_Agriculture), Hyderabad. There I established a bio-lab to produce and maintain mother-cultures of [beneficial soil microbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofertilizer) and test the quality of liquid biofertilizers. I also trained farmers across several villages in Andhra Pradesh, India, to become bio-entrepreneurs by self-producing and marketing biofertilizers.

Before joining CSA, I worked in the [RNA Biology Lab](https://www.rnabiologylab.co.in/) under the supervision of [Dr. Debojyoti Chakraborty](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PKSTTQ8AAAAJ&hl=en) at [CSIR-IGIB](https://www.igib.res.in/), New Delhi. My work included purification of Cas9 protein variants, comparison of off-target activities of SpCas9 (_Streptococcus pyogenes_ Cas9) and FnCas9 (_Francisella novicida_ Cas9 ) proteins, and identification of position-specific mismatch detection property of FnCas9 protein. I also discerned the staggered pattern of DNA cleavage produced by FnCas9. This work resulted in the development of an inexpensive paper-based COVID diagnostic kit named _[FELUDA](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-54338864)_. See my [publications](/publications) in this area. 

I have earned my BSc and MSc in Zoology from the [University of Delhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_University) with _summa cum laude_.

My hobbies are cooking, dancing, singing, yoga, and reading (non-fiction). I was born in [Siwan](https://siwan.nic.in/history/), the birthplace of the first President of India, [Dr. Rajendra Prasad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajendra_Prasad).
